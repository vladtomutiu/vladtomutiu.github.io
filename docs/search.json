I am a direct, technical, and intelligent winger who loves taking on defenders, and creating chances for myself and my teammates. My work ethic and discipline is also a strong attribute that has helped me become who I am both on and off the field. I can also play other positions as I played my freshman year at Cañada as a 9 (striker) as well as playing as an 8 (central midfielder) in my sophomore year."
